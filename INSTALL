Wakarimasen installation guide.

TODO: turn this into a script.
Wakarimasen is still experimental software - use it at your own risk and
if you know how to fix stuff when it breaks.


- Requirements: python2.6, werkzeug, sqlalchemy, jinja2
Fastcgi is highly recommended, but cgi is supported.

It can be made compatible with python2.5 by adding this line at the
beginning of template.py:

  from __future__ import with_statement

- Wakarimasen is meant to be installed from an existing wakaba+desuchan
installation. If you don't have one, clone this:

  git clone http://git.kiace.com.ar/desuchan.git

- First generate config files

  ./config.sed /path/to/wakaba/config.pl > config.py
  ./config_defaults.sed /path/to/wakaba/config_defaults.pl > config_defaults.py

- Now generate templates based on the built-in futaba_style.pl.
If you have your own version, use the -f/--filename parameter.

  python futaba_to_jinja.py
-or-
  python futaba_to_jinja.py -f /path/to/wakaba/futaba_style.pl

- Copy/create a few extra files needed for templates and other stuff:

  mkdir -p templates/include/boards/
  cp /path/to/wakaba/include/* templates/include/boards/
  touch templates/announcements_global.html
  touch templates/announcements.html
  touch templates/rules.html
  mkdir -p include/common/css
  cp /path/to/wakaba/board/css/* include/common/css
  touch spam.txt

- Review the generated config.py. If you used desuchan.git for the base config,
you'll have to set at least the first three entries to different values. The
format for SQL_ENGINE is:

  SQL_ENGINE = 'mysql://USERNAME:PASSWORD@HOSTNAME/DATABASE'

I also recommend changing the following (uncomment when needed)

  USE_XHTML = 0
  PAGE_EXT = '.html'

- Now make sure the shebang line in wakarimasen.py points to the right
python interpreter. If you use suexec for cgi, it must be chmod 755, too.

  http://example.com/wakarimasen.py

You should get a board not found WakaError. That means cgi is working.
Adding fastcgi support is explained later.

- Skip this step if you already have boards. To create a new board called
/temp/, do the following (assuming the desuchan git is in the current dir)

  mkdir temp
  mkdir temp/res
  ./board_config.sed desuchan/board_config.pl > temp/board_config.py

Now edit the new board_config.py, important settings are NUKE_PASS, TITLE
and SQL_TABLE. Keep in mind most of those options are not supported for now
(captcha, load balancing, proxy, etc). If you've disabled XHTML:

  config['USE_XHTML'] = 0
  config['HTML_SELF'] = 'wakaba.html'

Also disable captchas (not working yet):

 config['ENABLE_CAPTCHA'] = 0

- Go to http://example.com/wakarimasen.py?board=temp - This should rebuild the
cache and redirect you to your board. If you see the directory listing, add
this to your .htaccess (apache only)

  DirectoryIndex wakaba.html

Or .xhtml if you haven't changed PAGE_EXT. You might want to add additional
filenames after wakaba.html (like index.html, index.php, etc) if you put this
.htaccess in the site root. You can also put that htaccess on each individual
board.

- Edit the menu in templates/include/boards/header.html and other templates
as you please.

- Enjoy
