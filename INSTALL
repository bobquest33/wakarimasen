Wakarimasen installation guide.

Wakarimasen is still experimental software - use it at your own risk and
if you know how to fix stuff when it breaks.

- Requirements: python2.6, werkzeug, sqlalchemy, jinja2
Fastcgi is highly recommended, but cgi is supported.

- Copy config.py.example to config.py. Edit it and set ADMIN_PASS, SECRET and
SQL_ENGINE.  The format for SQL_ENGINE is the following:

  SQL_ENGINE = 'mysql://USERNAME:PASSWORD@HOSTNAME/DATABASE'

- Now make sure the shebang line in wakarimasen.py points to the right
python interpreter and that the file has execute permissions. If you use suexec
for cgi, it must be chmod 755, too.
Visit

  http://example.com/wakarimasen.py

This should open the first time setup page. Enter the ADMIN_PASS here.

- To create a new board called /temp/, copy the base_board directory:

  cp -r base_board temp

Edit temp/board_config.py. Important settings are NUKE_PASS, TITLE and
SQL_TABLE. Keep in mind most of those options are not supported for now
(captcha, load balancing, proxy, etc).

- Go to http://example.com/wakarimasen.py?board=temp - This should rebuild the
cache and redirect you to your board. If you see the directory listing, add
this to your .htaccess (apache only)

  DirectoryIndex wakaba.html

- Enjoy
