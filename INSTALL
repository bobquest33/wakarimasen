Wakarimasen installation guide.

TODO: turn this into a script.
Wakarimasen is still experimental software - use it at your own risk and
if you know how to fix stuff when it breaks.


- Requirements: python2.6, werkzeug, sqlalchemy, jinja2
Fastcgi is highly recommended, but cgi is supported.

- Copy/create a few extra files needed for templates and other stuff:

  mkdir -p templates/include/boards/
  cp /path/to/wakaba/include/* templates/include/boards/
  mkdir -p include/common/css
  cp /path/to/wakaba/board/css/* include/common/css
  touch spam.txt

- Copy config.py.example to config.py. Edit it and set ADMIN_PASS, SECRET and
  SQL_ENGINE.  The format for SQL_ENGINE is the following:

  SQL_ENGINE = 'mysql://USERNAME:PASSWORD@HOSTNAME/DATABASE'

- Now make sure the shebang line in wakarimasen.py points to the right
python interpreter. If you use suexec for cgi, it must be chmod 755, too.
Visit

  http://example.com/wakarimasen.py

You should get a board not found WakaError. That means cgi is working.
Adding fastcgi support is explained later.

- To create a new board called /temp/, copy the base_board directory:

  cp -r base_board temp

Edit temp/board_config.py. Important settings are NUKE_PASS, TITLE and
SQL_TABLE. Keep in mind most of those options are not supported for now
(captcha, load balancing, proxy, etc).

- Go to http://example.com/wakarimasen.py?board=temp - This should rebuild the
cache and redirect you to your board. If you see the directory listing, add
this to your .htaccess (apache only)

  DirectoryIndex wakaba.html

Or .xhtml if you haven't changed PAGE_EXT. You might want to add additional
filenames after wakaba.html (like index.html, index.php, etc) if you put this
.htaccess in the site root. You can also put that htaccess on each individual
board.

- Edit the menu in templates/include/boards/header.html and other templates
as you please.

- Enjoy
