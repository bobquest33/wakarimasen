if you know how to fix stuff when it breaks.

Installation instructions are available in the INSTALL.md file

FAQ:
    Q. What does "wakarimasen" mean?
    A. I don't know

    Q. No, seriously, what is it?
    A. *doesn't want to reply*. Huh. It's imageboard software written in
       python, based in a translation and compatible with wakaba+desuchan

    Q. What's wrong with wakaba+desuchan?
    A. There seems to be a memory leak, and restarting the process doesn't
       always work (they turn into zombie process sometimes, or it just
       ignores the term signal and never quits)
